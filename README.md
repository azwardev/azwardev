ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @azwardev, a passionate software developer with a keen interest in crafting elegant solutions to complex problems.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring various domains of software development, including web development, mobile app development and open-source projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new technologies and frameworks to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest trends in the ever-evolving tech industry. Currently, I'm delving deeper into React.js for frontend development and diving into Kubernetes for container orchestration.

ðŸ’¼ I'm open to collaborating on exciting projects that challenge me to think innovatively and push the boundaries of what's possible in software development. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects, building impactful applications, or participating in hackathons, I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at azwardev@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or diving into a captivating sci-fi novel.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you're interested in collaborating or just want to connect!
